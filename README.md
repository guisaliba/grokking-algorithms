## Description

This repository contains the code I wrote and personal notes while reading the book [Grokking Algorithms](https://www.manning.com/books/grokking-algorithms) by Aditya Y. Bhargava. The code in this repository is not a copy of the code in the book, it is my own implementation of the algorithms and data structures presented in the book, written in a few programming languages  I am familiar with. The repository is structured in chapters, each chapter has implementations of algorithms presented on it as well as notes for the chapter.
