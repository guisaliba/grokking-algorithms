    Grokking Algorithms

## Description

This repository contains the code I wrote while reading the book [Grokking Algorithms](https://www.manning.com/books/grokking-algorithms) by Aditya Y. Bhargava. The code in this repository is not a copy of the code in the book. It is my own implementation of the algorithms and data structures presented in the book, written in a few programming languages that I am familiar with. The repository is structured in chapters, each chapter containing a Markdown file with my notes on the chapter and folders for each kind of algorithm presented in the chapter.
