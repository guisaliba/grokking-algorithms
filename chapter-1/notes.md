# Binary search algorithm consists on halving the given data structure until the desired value is found.

Imagine you have a sorted array of numbers and you want to find the index of a given number. You can start by checking the middle element of the array. If the number you are looking for is smaller than the middle element, you can discard the right half of the array and focus on the left half. If the number you are looking for is bigger than the middle leement, you can discard the left half of the array and focus on the right half.

You can repeat this process until you find the number you are looking for or until you discard the whole array.
